    Briefing: <br>

    On August 13th, 2021 0400 our Montreal informant alerted us to the presence of [REDACTED] in a local abandoned hospital. Investigators
    were dispatched to the scene to confirm these reports. Investigators found traces of [REDACTED] on the walls and began a sweep of the area.
    In the third floor breakroom, Investigator number [REDACTED] discovered and secured a class Beta [REDACTED]. The specimen was cased and sent to
    Dr [REDACTED], currently staying in [REDACTED]. Communications with the doctor continued in regular ten-day intervals until December 24th 0500.
    We have reason to believe that the doctors work was on the precipice of completion, requiring only a final assay. However, the formula for the
    chemical he was to use in his final test is unknown. If you can recover the formula we can run the final test to unlock the [REDACTED].

    Before going missing, the doctor described inspiration for the formula coming from a suprising place that frightened him. His last
    Slack message was "Remind me to thank that bastard in engineering. He and the great Mr. Simmons will share in the glory lol."

    His last uploaded report to Central: <br>

    "The appearance of this item in Montreal is truly interesting. If it does prove to be of the same nature as the Mojave, Taipei, and Johanasburg discoveries, it would only stand to reason that we should continue searching in other cities."

    Psychological Profile on Doctor [REDACTED]: <br>

    Doctor [REDACTED] has been noted by his pre-screening psych eval as a fastidious man. Curiously, he has an aversion
    (he claims it's an aversion, presiding Psychologist labels is a phobia) to written words, despite having
    to surround himself with them for his work. He thus prefers to keep audio logs [Director's note: The audio
    logs have gone missing as well.]. In spite of this, his coworkers continually gift him books for special events.
    His aversion mixed with his social anxiety and neuroses prevents him from discarding these items. He has complained
    to the directors many times.
